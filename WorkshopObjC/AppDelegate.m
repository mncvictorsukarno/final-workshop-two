     Then we need to set rootViewController to define first view controller we want to show.

/*
 Workshop Notes ::
 UISceneSession lifecycle is not needed here because UIScene is part of SwiftUI.
 - Make sure to delete file of UISceneDelegate.h & UISceneDelegate.m
 - Make sure to delete "Application Scene Manifest" inside .plist file
 - Since we programmatically design UI layout, make sure to delete "Main storyboard file base name" inside .plist file
